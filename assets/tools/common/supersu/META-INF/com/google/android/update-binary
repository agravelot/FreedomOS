#
# The following su binary versions are included in the full package. Each
# should be installed only if the system has the same or newer API level
# as listed. The script may fall back to a different binary on older API
# levels. supolicy are all ndk/pie/19+ for 32 bit, ndk/pie/20+ for 64 bit.

# Non-static binaries are supported to be PIE (Position Independent
# Executable) from API level 16, and required from API level 20 (which will
# refuse to execute non-static non-PIE).
#
# The script performs several actions in various ways, sometimes
# multiple times, due to different recoveries and firmwares behaving
# differently, and it thus being required for the correct result.
#
# Overridable variables (shell):
#   BIN - Location of architecture specific files (native folder)
#   COM - Location of common files (APK folder)
#   LESSLOGGING - Reduce ui_print logging (true/false)
#   NOOVERRIDE - Do not read variables from /system/.supersu or
#                /data/.supersu
#
# Overridable variables (shell, /system/.supersu, /cache/.supersu,
# /data/.supersu):

#         from the time the ZIP was originall flashed, updates are lost.
# Shell overrides all, /data/.supersu overrides /cache/.supersu overrides
# /system/.supersu
#
# Note that if SELinux is set to enforcing, the daemonsu binary expects
# to be run at startup (usually from install-recovery.sh, 99SuperSUDaemon,
# app_process, or init.supersu.rc) from u:r:supersu:s0 (7.0+), u:r:init:s0 or
# u:r:kernel:s0 contexts. Depending on the current policies, it can also
# deal with u:r:init_shell:s0 and u:r:toolbox:s0 contexts. Any other context
# will lead to issues eventually.
#
# ----- "SYSTEM" INSTALL -----
#
# "System" install puts all the files needed in /system and does not need
# any boot image modifications. Default install method pre-Android-6.0
# (excluding Samsung-5.1).
#
# Even on Android-6.0+, the script attempts to detect if the current
# firmware is compatible with a system-only installation (see the
# "detect_systemless_required" function), and will prefer that
# (unless the SYSTEMLESS variable is set) if so. This will catch the
# case of several custom ROMs that users like to use custom boot images
# with - SuperSU will not need to patch these. It can also catch some
# locked bootloader cases that do allow security policy updates.
#
# To install SuperSU properly, aside from cleaning old versions and
# other superuser-type apps from the system, the following files need to
# be installed:
#
# API   source                        target                              chmod   chcon                       required

# *5: Only do this for the relevant bits. On a 64 bits system, leave the 32 bits files alone, or dynamic linker errors
#     will prevent the system from fully working in subtle ways. The bits of the su binary must also match!
#
# 17+   common/99SuperSUDaemon *6     /system/etc/init.d/99SuperSUDaemon  0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   optional

#
# 17+   'echo 1 >' or 'touch' *7      /system/etc/.installed_su_daemon    0644    u:object_r:system_file:s0   optional
# *7: the file just needs to exist or some recoveries will nag you. Even with it there, it may still happen.
#
# It may seem some files are installed multiple times needlessly, but
# it only seems that way. Installing files differently or symlinking
# instead of copying (unless specified) will lead to issues eventually.
#
# After installation, run '/system/xbin/su --install', which may need to
# perform some additional installation steps. Ideally, at one point,
# a lot of this script will be moved there.
#
# The included chattr(.pie) binaries are used to remove ext2's immutable
# flag on some files. This flag is no longer set by SuperSU's OTA
# survival since API level 18, so there is no need for the 64 bit versions.
# Note that chattr does not need to be installed to the system, it's just
# used by this script, and not supported by the busybox used in older
# recoveries.
#
# ----- "SYSTEM-LESS" INSTALL -----
#
# "System-less" install requires a modified boot image (the script can patch
# many boot images on-the-fly), but does not touch /system at all. Instead
# it keeps all the needed files in an image (/data/su.img) which is mounted
# to /su. Default install method on all Android-6.0+ and Samsung-5.1+
# devices.
#
# Note that even on 6.0+, system compatibility is checked. See the "SYSTEM"
# install section above.
#
# An ext4 image is created as /data/su.img, or /cache/su.img if /data could
# not be mounted. Similarly, the APK is placed as either /data/SuperSU.apk
# or /cache/SuperSU.apk. This is so we are not dependent on /data decryption
# working in recovery, which in the past has proved an issue on brand-new
# Android versions and devices.
#
# /sbin/launch_daemonsu.sh, which is added a service to init.rc, will mount
# the image at /su, and launch daemonsu from /su/bin/daemonsu. But before it
# does that, it will try to merge /data/su.img and /cache/su.img (leading),
# if both are present. It will also try to install the SuperSU APK.
#
# Files are expected at the following places (/su being the mountpoint of
# the ext4 image):
#
# API   source                        target                              chmod   chcon                       required
#
# 22+   common/Superuser.apk          /[data|cache]/SuperSU.apk           0644    u:object_r:system_file:s0   gui
#
# 22+   ARCH/su *1                    /su/bin/su                          0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# 22+                                 /su/bin/daemonsu                    0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# *1: su.pie for 17+ x86(_32) only
#
# 22+   ARCH/supolicy                 /su/bin/supolicy_wrapped            0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# 22+   /su/bin/su (symlink) *2       /su/bin/supolicy                    0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# 22+   ARCH/libsupol.so              /su/lib/libsupol.so                 0644    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# *2: when called this way, su sets the correct LD_LIBRARY_PATH and calls supolicy_wrapped
#
# 22+   ARCH/sukernel                 /su/bin/sukernel                    0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
#
# These files are automatically created on launch by daemonsu as needed:
# 22+   /system/bin/sh                /su/bin/sush                        0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
# 22+   /system/bin/app_process[64]   /su/bin/app_process                 0755    u:object_r:system_file:s0   required
#
# These files are injected into the boot image ramdisk:
# 22+   common/launch_daemonsu.sh     /sbin/launch_daemonsu.sh            0700    u:object_r:rootfs:s0        required
#
# On devices where / is in the system partition:
# 22+   ARCH/suinit                   /init                               0750    u:object_r:rootfs:s0        required
#
# The automated boot image patcher included makes the following modifications
# to the ramdisk:
#
# - Uses the supolicy tool to patch the sepolicy file
# - Injects /sbin/launch_daemon.sh
# - Creates /su
# - Removes /verity_key
# - Patches /*fstab*
# --- Removes support_scfs and verify flags
# --- Changes forceencrypt/forcefdeorfbe into encryptable
# --- Set ro mounts to use noatime
# - Patches /init.rc
# --- Removes 'setprop selinux.reload_policy' occurences
# --- Adds a SuperSU:PATCH marker with the version of the sukernel tool
# --- Adds a SuperSU:STOCK marker listed the SHA1 of the original boot image
# - Adds /init.supersu.rc
# --- Adds a sukernel.mount property trigger that mounts /data/su.img to /su
# --- Adds the daemonsu service that launches /sbin/launch_daemon.sh
# --- Adds exec /sbin/launch_daemonsu.sh on post-fs-data
# - Patches /init.environ.rc
# --- Adds PATH variable if it does not exist
# --- Prepends /su/bin to the PATH variable
# - Patches /*.rc
# --- Adds a seclabel to services and execs that are missing one
# - In case the device has the root directory inside the system partition:
# --- /system_root contents are copied to /boot
# --- All files mentioned above are modified in /boot instead of /
# --- /boot/*fstab* is modified to mount / to /system_root, and
#     bind-mount /system to /system_root/system
# --- Kernel binary is patched to load from initramfs instead of system
#
# In case this documentation becomes outdated, please note that the sukernel
# tool is very chatty, and its output tells you exactly what it is doing
# and how. In TWRP, you can view this output by catting /tmp/recovery.log
# after flashing the ZIP.
#
# The boot image patcher creates a backup of the boot image it patches, for
# future restoration. It cannot re-patch a patched boot image, it will restore
# the previous boot image first. /[data|cache]/stock_boot_*.gz
#
# The boot image patcher currently only supports GZIP compressed ramdisks, and
# boot images in the standard Android boot image format.
#
# During boot image patch, /data/custom_ramdisk_patch.sh will be called,
# with the name of the ramdisk cpio file as parameter. The script must
# replace the input file and return a 0 exit code.
#
# Just before flashing, the boot image patcher will call
# /data/custom_boot_image_patch.sh with the name of the patched boot image
# as parameter. A device-specific patcher can further patch the boot image
# if needed. It must replace the input file and return a 0 exit code.
