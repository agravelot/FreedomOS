I LOVE Dirac and use it with the SHAT preset and AM3D and XHiFi for music.  
I use the N7 Beta as my main music player with Neutron as a backup.  I also use Google Play Music to get all the new releases.

For watching video, I turn off AM3D and use Atmos for its increased theater-like soundstage.
